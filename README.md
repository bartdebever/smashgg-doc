# smashgg-doc

Community documentation based on the [smash.gg](https://www.smash.gg) API.
Once the new alpha api is released for public that folder will be moved towards the root of this repository

## Legal/Disclosure

I am by no means employed or associated to smash.gg. All of this info provided is from the community and details such as models/DTO descriptions may change due to smash.gg updating their API.

## Contribute

Feel free to contribute to the documentation about the API.

## General notating

- The proper way to name smash.gg within documentation/libraries is `smash.gg` in all lower case.
- CORS is not enabled on the old API but is on the new alpha API.
